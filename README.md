This repository contains default templates for Pull Requests in this organization.
Those templates are being applied to the repositories that do not contain their own custom templates.
See github documentation for reference: [default-community-health-file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#).

# Evolution process
Default Pull Request templates are meant to be moving target and fulfil needs of our organization.
In order to achieve that team members can leave their remarks and add improvement propositions using **GitHub issues**.
